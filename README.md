# Apollo.io MCP Server

A powerful Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation for seamless Apollo.io API integration, enabling AI assistants to interact with Apollo.io data for people and organization enrichment.

## Features

- **People Enrichment**: Enrich contact data with comprehensive information
- **Organization Enrichment**: Get detailed company information and insights
- **People Search**: Find people based on various criteria
- **Organization Search**: Discover companies matching specific criteria
- **Job Postings**: Access job postings for specific organizations

## Installation

```bash
npm install @agentx-ai/apollo-io-mcp-server
```

## Running the Server

### Option 1: HTTP Server (Recommended for Local Development)

Run the MCP server as an HTTP server on a local port:

```bash
# Install dependencies first
npm install

# Set your Apollo.io API key
export APOLLO_IO_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Run the HTTP server (default port: 3000)
npm run start:http

# Or run with custom port
PORT=8080 npm run start:http

# For development with auto-reload
npm run dev:http
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3000` (or your specified port) with the following endpoints:
- **SSE Endpoint**: `GET http://localhost:3000/mcp` - Establishes the SSE stream
- **Messages Endpoint**: `POST http://localhost:3000/messages?sessionId=<session_id>` - Receives client JSON-RPC requests
- **Health Check**: `GET http://localhost:3000/health` - Server health status

### Option 2: Stdio Server (For MCP Inspector)

Run with stdio transport for testing with MCP Inspector:

```bash
npm install -g .
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector apollo-io-mcp-server
```

Then add `APOLLO_IO_API_KEY` in Environment Variable
